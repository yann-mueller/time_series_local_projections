# Time Series: Local Projections
Local Projections offer a convenient way to directly estimate cumulative impulse response functions (IRF) with a model in differences in the background. In this code example, we use an exogenous shock series of supply chain disruptions to predict the effect on German industrial production following the framework of Jordá (2005) and Plagborg-Møller and Wolf (2021).
This is an outtake from our project on <a href="https://github.com/yann-mueller/waterway_shocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantifying Waterway Supply Chain Shocks</a>.

## Statistical Background
The model is defined as follows:
